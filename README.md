# Bootcamp_Weather_Dashboard
This is the repo for the UT weather dashboard challenge.
## Description
This was the weather dashboard assignment. When a city is typed into the text box and enter is clicked then the current weather as well as the forcast for the next 5 days will present it self. As you search for more cities, the name of the previous city will be added to a local storage and displayed as a list. If any item on the list is clicked then the search will revert back to that city. The order the list will not change. The basic weather data as well as an icon for the weather are presented for each time stamp.
